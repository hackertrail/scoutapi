# Scout API

## Background

Lead forms, employment histories, sales plans - these all require proper references to existing companies. Most of the time, this data is just captured as a free text field, and time is wasted when reviewing/revisiting this information to figure out which company is being referenced.

The Scout API provides rapid, easy and lightweight access to a comprehensive global list of companies and returns details about the company (logo, LinkedIn profile, company size, etc) that can be used to validate and reference the entity in the future.
